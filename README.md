Hello World

Hi Team,

I have successfully developed the API functionality with Marvin's code (powerpoint presentation transcription) using the Django Rest Framework.

The API allows users to call an endpoint with their video file, and in return, they receive a response with the generated output file. Moreover, I have implemented a feature to store both the input video files and the corresponding generated output files in the database. As a result, the administrator can log in to the admin panel and easily modify the database as needed.

I have attached sourcecode, input video file and Instruction file. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.


Regards,
Debrup
